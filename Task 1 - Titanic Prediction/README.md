# Task 1 – Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project is part of my **CodSoft Data Science Internship (2025)**.

## 🔍 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, class, etc.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`
- Columns include: Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, Embarked, Survived

## 🧪 Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning: Filled missing values
- Feature Encoding: Converted categorical to numeric
- Model Training: Logistic Regression
- Evaluation: Accuracy and Classification Report

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
